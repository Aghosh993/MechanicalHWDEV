This repository contains the CAD (SolidWorks 2012) files along with fabrication outputs for the chassis of a custom-designed 500mm-class quadcopter I have been working on since the summer of 2016. There is significant flight heritage up to Rev 3 so far, with Rev 4 being a new version currently under R&D. Material choices as of now are 0.25"-thick clear Acrylic for all laser-cut components, and PLA for all 3D-printed components.

Transition plans:

- Eventually move to carbon fiber for all 2D forms, and try to reduce use of 3D printing as much as possible to increase DFM positives.

- Transition to CNC machining of any 2.5D/3D forms to increase overall strength and crash survivability.

- Add PCB design and fab outputs to a sister "QuadcopterElectronics" repo, and centralize the flight software tree to create a triad of repos from which a full vehicle can be built with as much automation as possible :)

- World domination :)
